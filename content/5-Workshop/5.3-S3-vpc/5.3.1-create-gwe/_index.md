+ For VPC, select **VPC Cloud** from the drop-down.
+ For **Configure route tables**, select the route table that is already associated with **two subnets** (note: this is not the main route table for the VPC, but a second route table created by CloudFormation).

+ **For Policy**, leave the default option, **Full Access**, to allow full access to the service. You will deploy **a VPC endpoint policy** in a later lab module to demonstrate restricting access to **S3 buckets** based on policies.
