To prepare for this part of the workshop you will need to:
+ Deploying a CloudFormation stack 
+ Modifying a VPC route table. 

These components work together to simulate on-premises DNS forwarding and name resolution.

#### Deploy the CloudFormation stack

The CloudFormation template will create additional services to support an on-premises simulation:
+ One Route 53 Private Hosted Zone that hosts Alias records for the PrivateLink S3 endpoint
+ One Route 53 Inbound Resolver endpoint that enables "VPC Cloud" to resolve inbound DNS resolution requests to the Private Hosted Zone
+ One Route 53 Outbound Resolver endpoint that enables "VPC On-prem" to forward DNS requests for S3 to "VPC Cloud"

1. Click the following link to open the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/reinvent-endpoints-builders-session/R53CF.yaml&stackName=PLOnpremSetup). The required template will be pre-loaded into the menu. Accept all default and click Create stack.

It may take a few minutes for stack deployment to complete. You can continue with the next step without waiting for the deployemnt to finish.

#### Update on-premise private route table

This workshop uses a strongSwan VPN running on an EC2 instance to simulate connectivty between an on-premises datacenter and the AWS cloud. Most of the required components are provisioned before your start. To finalize the VPN configuration, you will modify the "VPC On-prem" routing table to direct traffic destined for the cloud to the strongSwan VPN instance.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console 

2. Select the instance named infra-vpngw-test. From the Details tab, copy the Instance ID and paste this into your text editor

![ec2 id](/fcaj-workshop-quangttse196220-fptu/images/5-Workshop/5.4-S3-onprem/ec2-onprem-id.png)

3. Navigate to the VPC menu by using the Search box at the top of the browser window.

4. Click on Route Tables, select the RT Private On-prem route table, select the Routes tab, and click Edit Routes.

5. Click Add route.
+ Destination: your Cloud VPC cidr range
+ Target: ID of your infra-vpngw-test instance (you saved in your editor at step 1)
